tpoll
=====

Tpoll is the beginning of a new framework for polling network devices.

It is currently completely non-functional and internal.

The basic goal is to have a massively scalable solution that can be
dynamically configured at run-time, and ultimately handle ALL
information-requests to network devices, be it SNMP or GNMI or god knows
what.

The first iteration will focus on fundamentals and SNMP.
