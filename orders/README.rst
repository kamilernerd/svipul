This directory contains a set of orders I use to test svipul, and it
changes along with development.

While some of this can be used as reference, there are no guarantees that
this is up to date or complete.

The vm/ directory points at - you guessed it - a vm I have running
Linux/Debian. The ex/ directory points to orders for my Juniper EX3300
switch.
