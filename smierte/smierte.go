package smierte

/*
Package smierte handles loading MIB files and modules (SMI)-stuff. The name
is a play on SMI and smerte (pain), because this is such a painful process.

While this is based on gosmi, we should try to hide as much as that as
possible because it's not unlikely that it'll be switched.
