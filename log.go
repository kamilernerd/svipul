/*
log.go is largely a wrapper around log for now, mainly so I can start doing
regular calls to log without having to worry about future-proofing it.

Add wrappers on demand.

The one concession it has is that it adds Debug/Debugf which evaluates if
we've turned on debugging. This makes calls to tpoll.Debug() very fast
when it's disabled.
