/*
Package tpoll is an advanced library and toolset for polling large amounts
of network devices, initially with SNMP, but conceptually with any relevant
protocol.

It works, or will work, through a central work-distribution database/api,
and multiple, largely independent pollers. The results are reported using
Skogul.
